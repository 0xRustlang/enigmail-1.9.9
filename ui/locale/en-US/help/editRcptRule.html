<h3>Using the Enigmail Rules Editor: Edit PGP Rule</h3>
<p>In the Rules Editor, you can specify defaults per recipient for enabling 
encryption, signing and PGP/MIME, and to define what PGP key(s) to use. In this 
dialog, you can specify the rules for a single recipient, and for a group 
of recipients with very similar attributes.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set PGP Rules for</span>: Contains the email
    addresses of the recipients (without names, i.e. just an address like
    <tt>somebody@email.com</tt>). You can specify several email addresses, separated by spaces.
    The address specified here can consist of
    only the domain section so that mail to any address at that domain will
    be matched, e.g. <tt>@email.com will</tt> allow matching to <tt>body@email.com</tt>,
    <tt>somebody@email.com</tt>, <tt>anybody@email.com</tt>, etc.
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Match begin</span>: 
    This modifies the matching of the address as seen from right. With this
    disabled, entering an address of <tt>body@email.com</tt> would also match
    <tt>somebody@email.com</tt>, <tt>anybody@email.com</tt>, etc. Enabling this will only
    match <tt>body@email.com</tt>. If multiple addresses are entered, the setting
    will apply to all.
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Match end</span>:
    This modifies the matching of the address as seen from left. With this disabled,
    entering an address of <tt>body@email.domain</tt> will match
    <tt>body@email.domain.com</tt>, <tt>body@email.domain.net</tt>, etc. Enabling this option
    will exactly match from the right side, e.g. <tt>@email.domain.com</tt> will only
    match <tt>@email.domain.com</tt>. If multiple addresses are entered, the setting
    will apply to all.
    <br><br>
    With both <span style="font-weight: bold;">Match begin</span> and 
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Match end</span> enabled, the rule will only
    trigger on an exact email address match.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Key(s) to use</span>: contains
    the PGP key ID's to use for the recipient(s). These can be selected from
    a list by clicking on the <em>Select Key(s)</em> button.
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Default for Signing</span>: enable or disable
    message signing. This either uses or overrides what you have specified
    in the message composition window. The values are:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Never</i>: disable signing, even if it was enabled in the message
       composition window (overrules the other values)<br>
    </li>
    <li><i>Yes, if selected from in Message Composition</i>: leave signing 
      as specified in the message composition window
    </li>
    <li><i>Always</i>: enable signing, even if it was <span
      style="font-style: italic;">not</span> enabled in the message
      composition window
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">These signing settings are applied for
all rules that match. If one of the rules disables signing, the message
will not be signed, regardless of other rules that specify <i>Always</i>.<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Encryption</span>: enable or
    disable message encryption. The allowed settings and their meaning are
    the same as for message signing.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">PGP/MIME</span>: enable or
    disable the use of the PGP/MIME (RFC 3156) message encoding. 
    If PGP/MIME is disabled, the
    messages are encoded using "inline PGP". The allowed values and their
    meaning are the same as for message signing.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The rules are processed in the order displayed in the list in the 
<em>PGP Rules Editor</em>. Whenever a rule 
matches a recipient and contains a PGP Key ID, in addition to using the 
specified Key ID, the recipient is not considered anymore when processing 
further rules.</p>
<p><i>Note:</i> The rule editor is not yet complete. It is possible to write
some more advanced rules by directly editing the rules file (these rules
should then not be edited anymore in the rule editor). <a

information</a> for directly editing the file
is available on the Enigmail Homepage</p>
