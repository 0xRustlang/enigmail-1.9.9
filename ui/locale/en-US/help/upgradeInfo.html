<title>What's New in Enigmail v2.0</title>
<body>
<h1>What's New in Enigmail v2.0?</h1>
<p>Welcome to Enigmail v2.0! We introduced a lot of new features:</p>

<h2>Hiding the Message Subject</h2>
<p>
  We developed a new method that hides the email subject by replacing the visible subject with "Encrypted Mesage".
  Once such a message is decrypted, the original subject is replaced automatically.
  <i>(Note: this feature requires the message to be sent with PGP/MIME.)</i>
</p>

<h2>Improved behavior of Encrypt and Sign Buttons</h2>
<p>The Encrpyt and Sign buttons in the message composer window now work for both the OpenPGP and S/MIME protocols.
If both algorithms are possible, then Enigmail will try to prefer the one for which all keys are available.

<h2>Support for Autocrypt</h2>
<p>
  Enigmail now supports <a href="https://autocrypt.org/">Autocrypt</a>, a new standard to distribute keys
  as part of sent messages.
  Enigmail automatically imports keys from Autocrypt-compliant messages, such that over time more and more emails can be encrypted.
</p>

<h2>Support for p≡p (Pretty Easy Privacy)</h2>
<p>
  Enigmail now contains a <a href="https://pep-project.org/">p≡p Junior Mode</a>.
  You currently need to manually install p≡p for this purpose; this will change in a future release.
  The p≡p Junior Mode allows you to use OpenPGP encryption as transparently as possible;
  you don't need to care for key management and synchronization of keys between devices anymore.
